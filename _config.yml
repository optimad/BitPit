# Some gems, like jekyll-mentions, need to parse single html files. If those
# file contain closing divs (which were open elsewhere) the parser will see
# there's an extra div and remove it as it was never opened. When generating
# the programmer's manual we open some divs in a header.html file and close
# them in a separate footer.html file. For being able to generate the
# programmer's manual these gems cannot be used.
